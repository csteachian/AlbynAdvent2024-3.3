        <h2 style="color: white;">Santa's Naughty or Nice List</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Santa's Naughty and Nice list is a legendary parchment that keeps 
            track of children's behavior throughout the year. Carefully maintained by 
            Santa himself, the list is divided into two columns: "Nice," showcasing 
            names written in elegant calligraphy, and "Naughty,"
            marked with bold, hurried scrawls. 
            This enchanted list is said to be updated daily 
            by the magic of holiday spirit, ensuring accuracy. 
            Those on the Nice list can expect gifts and surprises on 
            Christmas morning, while the Naughty 
            list serves as a gentle reminder to improve behavior. The list embodies 
            Santa's belief in kindness, second chances, and the joy of giving.</p>

                Because hes double-claus-ious!</p>
