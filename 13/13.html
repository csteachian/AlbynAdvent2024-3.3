      At Christmas, Superman's headquarters, the Fortress of Solitude, is
      transformed into a winter wonderland. The icy, crystalline walls of the
      fortress gleam under the soft glow of holiday lights, while snow gently
      falls outside. Inside, Superman decorates with care, placing a towering
      tree adorned with ornaments from around the world and hanging stockings
      for his closest allies. Despite his heroic duties, the holiday spirit
      fills the air, as even the Man of Steel takes a rare moment to enjoy the
      warmth of peace and goodwill.
